# History Course of Study

## What is History?

According to Wikipedia (with my assent), [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History)
is the study of the past as it is described in written documents.  It is an
umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery,
collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about
these events.  History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a
narrative to examine and analyze a sequence of past events, and objectively
determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.

History is not a list of events, people, and battles along with dates (though
such lists are often helpful with context).  Additionally, I would suggest that
history is the study of any [primary source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source), including works of art,
photographs, etc.

## What I provide

Much of the content provided will be in a narrative form.  Unlike what an
actual college class SHOULD BE like, I will provide most secondary and tertiary
sources in the form of online content such as YouTube videos.  I will attempt to
only provide content where I can verify their source material (to some extent).

# Primary Historical Topics

It is difficult to separate history into convenient buckets. For example, it is
easy to break up the ancient world around the Bronze Age Collapse, but that
particular event doesn't really affect societies throughout most of Africa and
Asia the way it affects the Levant.  To that end, I've given it the old college
try but my groupings will be imperfect and prone to change as I expand my
knowledge beyond "Western" history.
