# Alex's Grand Bazaar of Online Learning

I really enjoyed college. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end and we must leave the institutes of higher learning to become productive members of society. If you're like me, you may look back and recall all the things you nce knew but have now begun to slip as the rigors of life and work take a tool on the once fertile garden that was your late teens and early twenties memory. To that end, I've sought to partially recreate the college experience for myself and you, dear readers, by making any and all free content I can find on interesting college level topics, available here in a generally syllabus-like format. In addition, I may provide my own summaries of useful non-free information and/or recommendations to absorb said material for yourself.
